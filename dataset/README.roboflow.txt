The dataset includes 4970 images.
3d print failure are annotated in YOLOv8 format.

The following pre-processing was applied to each image:
* Auto-orientation of pixel data (with EXIF-orientation stripping)
* Resize to 640x640 (Stretch)

The following augmentation was applied to create 3 versions of each source image:
* Random rotation of between -11 and +11 degrees
* Random brigthness adjustment of between -45 and +45 percent
* Salt and pepper noise was applied to 2 percent of pixels

The following transformations were applied to the bounding boxes of each image:
* Random shear of between -15° to +15° horizontally and -15° to +15° vertically
